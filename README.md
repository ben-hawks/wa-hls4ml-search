# Roadmap


## make plan in .py file

- make model generation flow based on possible layers and current layer (basic idea is to get a input -> conv -> flatten -> dense -> dense going)
- add hyperparameter selection for more customizable layers (gen_config)
- add random generation and full model layers
- add selection for number of layers and full randomized generality
